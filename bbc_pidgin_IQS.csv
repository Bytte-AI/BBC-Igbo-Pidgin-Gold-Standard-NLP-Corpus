Yoweri Museveni seize di top job for 1986 afta one armed revolution and for di age of 81, e no dey show sign of stepping down.

Im time as leader follow long period of peace and significant development, for which many dey grateful. But im critics tok say e maintain im grip on power through mixture of sidelining opponents and compromising independent institutions.

""We no believe in [presidential] term limits,"" e bin once tell BBC, secure in his role afta e win di election for di fifth time.

A year later, e remove di age limit for presidential candidate – wey make way, many believe, for Museveni to bicom president for life.

Museveni journey start for 1944, wen dem born am into a family of cattle keepers for Ankole, western Uganda.

E grow up during Uganda struggle for independence from UK, wey bin follow a period of brutality and turbulence under Milton Obote and Idi Amin.

For many years, Museveni no sabi di date dem born am, e write for inside im memoir: ""We bin get real life-threatening challenges like extra-judicial killings and looting… we no get time to worry about details like dates of birth.""

For 1967, Museveni comot Uganda to attend di University of Dar es Salaam for neighbouring Tanzania. For there, e study economics and political science and e forge alliances wit politically active students from around di region.

Museveni name gain prominence for 1970s, afta one coup by di notorious Idi Amin.

Museveni bin help form di Front for National Salvation - one of di rebel groups wey wit di help of Tanzania remove Oga Amin.

Oga Amin bin dey popular for crushing dissent and expelling di kontri Asian community. Under im eight-year rule, dem kill about 400,000 pipo.

""E bin dey part of di colonial system,"" Museveni tell di Global Indian Network for one recent interview. ""Idi Amin dey ignorant... a bit chauvinistic"".

Following Amin fall, former President Milton Obote return to power through general election. However, Museveni refuse to accept Obote leadership, e claim say dem rig di vote.

E launch one rebel struggle for 1981 and five years later, im rebel group, di National Resistance Movement (NRM), seize power and Museveni bicom leader.

Uganda economy begin to grow steadily and ova 10 years, di kontri see an average annual growth of more dan 6%.

Primary school enrolment double and HIV levels drop bicos of one anti-Aids campaign wey di president spearhead.

Museveni bicom di darling of di West, but im reputation drop for 1998, wen Uganda and Rwanda attack neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo in support of rebels wey dey fight to overthrow di govment.

Around dis time, critics also complain say di president dey grow less tolerant of opposing views. E also bicom clear say im no get plans to leave power.

Museveni bin tok for one 1986 collection of writing: ""Di problem of Africa in general, and Uganda in particular, no be dat of di pipo but leaders wey wan overstay for power.""

But by 2005, e be like say im view don change and Uganda constitution dey amended, wey remove di limitation on how many terms a president fit serve.

For 2017, dem also remove di age limit for presidential candidates - a move wey bin lead to MPs throwing chairs for one chaotic parliamentary brawl.

Museveni don also face allegations say e weaken di independence of key institutions.

In particular, Uganda judiciary chop accuse say dem dey employ so-called ""cadre judges"" wey dia loyalty lie wit di govment.

Wen judges go against di govment, dem sometimes dey see themselves at loggerheads wit di authorities.

For example, for December 2005, armed security personnel bin raid di High Court for di capital, Kampala, dem rearrest members of one suspected rebel group wey dem free from treason charges.

Di media independence also dey threatened. On di surface, Uganda get lively media industry, but dem don raid plenty organizations and detain several journalists.

Perhaps di most significant factor for Museveni longevity na di way e take subdue potential opposition forces.

Wen e bicom clear say Museveni no get plans to leave power, some of im former associates start to break away. As dem comot, security agencies turn dia attention on dem.

For instance, Kizza Besigye of di opposition Forum for Democratic Change, na Museveni doctor bifor.

E run against di president for 2001. Since then, dem don arrest and prosecute am plenty times.

For 2024, e mysteriously disappear from Nairobi, only to appear four days later for one Ugandan military court. E still dey for jail on treason charges, wey e don deny.

Di Pop star wey turn politician, Bobi Wine, na di latest Museveni critic to face di wrath of di state.

Di 43-year-old opposition leader, wey im star power draw huge crowds of youngsters, bin chop arrest, dem put am for prison and charge am wit crimes wey include treason. Dem later drop all di charges.

For 2021, police tear-gas and even shoot Bobi Wine plus im supporters. Di police say e disobey coronavirus restrictions on large gatherings.

During di current campaign period, security forces don use ""firearms and live ammunition to scata peaceful assemblies"" and abduct opposition party members in unmarked vans, one UN report tok.

For di middle of dis, Museveni tell kontri pipo say ""one soja dey carry 120 bullets"". However, e bin order police say make dem no beat opposition supporters but make dem use tear gas instead.

Museveni supporters point to di relative stability wey Uganda don enjoy for decades since e dey power.

Emmanuel Lumala Dombo, one tok-tok pesin for di NRM, tok say more dan 1.7 million pipo bin japa to Uganda afta dem run from di kasala wey dey happun for dia own countries.

""Forty years ago, we bin dey among di biggest exporters of refugees among di neighbouring countries wey surround us,"" Dombo tell BBC. ""Right now Uganda na di biggest host of refugees for Africa.""

One Museveni supporter wey bin surprisingly, turn up for one Bobi Wine rally tok di same thing.

Ndyasima Patrick tell BBC say im go vote for Museveni becos ""na im keep us alive for all these years"".

E also dey respect Museveni age and e feel say Bobi Wine go only dey ready to lead Uganda wen e reach im 50s.

Museveni govment recently begin encourage foreign investment, as dem don strike deals wit di likes of China, di United Kingdom plus di United Arab Emirates. E say im want make Uganda bicom a middle-income country by 2040.

Museveni see imsef no be only as a stable, ambitious presence, but also as a nurturing figure for Uganda youth. E dey fondly call im young followers Bazukulu (wey mean grandchildren for di Luganda language) and dem dey call am wir nicknames M7 or Sevo.

But wit eye on Bobi Wine, wey roughly be half of Museveni age, di president dey always show im vitality.

For 2020, to encourage exercise during lockdown, dem feem am as e dey do press-ups, and e repeat di trick several times dat year, plus in front of cheering students.

E don tok about im health on numerous occasions, late last year e say: ""I don dey hia wit you for 40 years now. You don ever hear say I go hospital? Except wen I get [coronavirus] for 21 days.""

As Museveni ages, critics worry say e dey turn di kontri into im family affairs.

Dem note say di president wife, Janet, na di education minister and im son, Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba na di head of di army.

Museveni grandson bin also enrol for di army for July, one move pipo see as say e dey extend di family dynasty.

Di NRM neva tok much on how dem plan to manage Museveni succession, but speculation full ground say im 51-year-old son, Gen Kainerugaba go take im place.

Should dis come to pass, e fit jeopardise Museveni legacy of stability. Pipo sabi Gen Kainerugaba as pesin wey dey unpredictable and provocative, especially on social media.

E bin use X to joke about invading Kenya, rile Ethiopia by backing Egypt during one kwanta between di two countries, e also admit say e detain Bobi Wine bodyguard for im basement.

At di moment, however, wit almost four decades of experience behind him, Museveni dey confident say im go win di election for di seventh time.

""Uganda dey secure. Go out and vote,"" e tell di public during one New Year Eve address. ""Di Ugandan NRM dey unstoppable.""

""Ebo Noah come here come take pictures and videos of dis boats we dey build for here. In fact, one day dem even wan beat am as dem see say he dey use di pictures to create content for social media say he dey build ark,"" one of di fisherman tell ""headless youtuber"".

""Di time we see di video, we dey laugh sake of we dey here wey we see am when he dey capture everytin, so all be lie. He no dey build any ark anywhere,"" di fishermen tok.

Unless di speech dey coupled wit fraud, coercion or real-world disruption, criminal prosecution risk turning di state into arbiter of belief,"" Kwaku Azar write.

Twenty women don tell BBC say di drugs wey dem give dem for RLS don spoil dia lives.

One report from pharmaceutical company GSK, wey BBC see, show say connection between one drug wey dem dey call dopamine agonist and ""misleading"" sexual behaviour bin already show since 2003.

Di report still mention case of one man wey sexually assault one pikin while e dey take Parkinson's medication.

Even though di information leaflet no clearly mention dis side effect, di UK medicines regulator tell BBC say general warning dey about increased sexual desire and harmful behaviour.

Like many women, Claire first get RLS wen she bin pregnant. Apart from strong urge to move, she dey suffer insomnia and crawling feeling under her skin.

Wen di problem kontinu afta she born, doctors prescribe dopamine agonist drug called ropinirole for her.

She say doctors no warn her about any side effects.

At first, di drug work well for her RLS, but afta about one year, she begin feel strange sexual desire.

Claire say she begin dey leave house early morning just go look for sex.

She say she go wear shirt wey show her bodi well, and even wen she wear jacket, she go bend her chest down anytime she see man.

She say even though she get partner, she still dey do all dis tins for dangerous places.

""One part of your mind know say wetin you dey do wrong, but di tin affect you sotey you no even know wetin you dey do,"" Claire tok.

She say e take years bifor she realise say na di medication cause di cravings, and immediately she stop di drug, di behaviour disappear.

She say she feel shame and depression sake of di danger wey she put hersef inside.

According to health bodi Nice, impulsive behaviours like gambling and increased sexual desire don dey listed as side effects for dopamine agonist drugs for long time, and dem tink say between six and 17 percent of RLS patients fit experience am.

According to NHS, ""common"" side effects normally affect only about one percent of pipo.

Di drugs dey work by copying dopamine, one natural chemical for brain wey dey help control movement. Dem still dey call dopamine ""happiness hormone"" becos e dey active wen somtin sweet or rewarding happun.

But experts say dopamine agonist drugs fit reduce sense of consequence by boosting emotional feelings, wey fit lead to risky behaviour.

Among di cases wey GSK describe as ""misleading practice"" for dia 2003 report, na two men wey dem prescribe ropinirole for Parkinson's disease.

For one case, one 63-year-old man sexually assault seven-year-old girl and go prison.

Di documents say di man sexual desire increase well-well since e start ropinirole, and di problem stop afta dem reduce di dose.

According to Professor Valerie Vaughan from University of Cambridge, di real number of pipo wey dey get ""misleading"" sexual behaviour from di drugs no dey known becos many no dey report am.

""Plenti shame and stigma dey around am, and pipo no realise say na medication dey cause am,"" she tok.

Professor Vaughan believe say hospitals and doctors suppose warn patients clearly about risky sexual behaviour, becos di effect fit dey ""devastating"".

Dem believe say RLS dey affect about one in evri 20 adults, and women dey almost times two more likely to suffer am dan men.

Di 20 patients wey BBC tok to say doctors no only fail to warn dem about serious side effects, dem also no follow up to check how di drugs dey affect dem later.

Sarah dey 50 years old wen dem prescribe anoda dopamine agonist drug for her from different company.

""Bifor, even if Brad Pitt enta room naked, I no go dey interested,"" she tok. ""But dis drug turn me to woman wey get strong sexual addiction.""

Sarah begin dey sell used underwear and sexual videos online, arrange phone sex wit strangers, and still begin shop anyhow, wey put her inside £30,000 debt.

Later dem admit her for treatment, but dem collect her driving licence and she lose her job.

""I turn to tins wey no dey healthy. I know say dis behaviour no be me, but I no fit control am,"" she tell BBC.

Anoda woman, Sue, say dem prescribe two different dopamine drugs for her and nobodi warn her about compulsive behaviour side effects.

She say wen dem give her di second drug, she even mention say she don start gamble and don lose £80,000.

""E affect my family badly. I lose money wey for change our lives,"" she tok.

""But at dat time, I no know say no be my fault.""

BBC don learn say four Parkinson's disease patients take GSK go court for 2011.

Dem say ropinirole cause gambling debts and destroy relationships, and dem complain say GSK no include warning until March 2007, even though clinical studies don show link between di drug and such behaviour since early 2000s.

Similar serious side effects don dey reported for oda kontris, especially for Parkinson's patients.

For France, one court order one father of two to get compensation afta e complain say ropinirole force am enta homosexuality, while anoda man wey neva get criminal record begin torture cats.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommend say make dem only use di drugs for short-term treatment.

Some of di women wey BBC tok to still complain say long-term use of di drugs make dia RLS worse.

Dis make doctors increase di dose, wey later increase dia compulsive behaviour.

Consultant neurologist Dr Guy Leschner say di drugs still dey important, but pharmaceutical companies, health authorities and doctors need to warn patients beta.

""Evribodi no know di kain serious changes wey fit happun,"" e tok.

Forstatement,GSK tell BBC say ropinirole don go through ""extensive clinical trials"".

Di company say di drug dey effective, but like all drugs, e get side effects and dem clearly state dem for prescribing information.

About di 2003 research wey link di drug to ""misleading"" sexual behaviour, GSK say dem share am wit health authorities.

Di latest pamphlet for ropinirole mention changes in sexual interest for five different places, warning say di feelings fit become ""unusually high"" or ""excessive"".

UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency say even though di warning no clearly mention ""inappropriate"" sexual behaviour, e include general warning about harmful activities.

Dem add say health professionals suppose explain di risk to patients, and say no be evribodi go experience such side effects.

Di oda six presidential candidates na  Frank Bulira, Robert Kasibante, Joseph Mabirizi, Nandala Mafabi, Mugisha Muntu, and Mubarak Munyagwa. All of dme na man dem be.

Di Elecotral Commission ansa Mpambara accuse for dem through dia tok-tok pesin Julius Mucunguzi wey say di joinbodi bin follow clear guidelines for id nomination and vetting process.

E tok say, ""if no female candidate carry herself come and meet all di requirements successfully, di commission no go bend dia riles. E dey possible to get all female race, all male race or mixed one"".

According to di Electoral Commission, anyone wey wan run for president must be Ugandan by birth, at least 18 years old, and must be registered voter.

Presidential aspirants also need to pay nomination fee wey cost 20 million Uganda shillings (about £4,200).

For dem to clear pesin to run, di candidate for don present at least 100 signatures from at least two-thirds of di kontri 146 districts.

Yvonne say di electoral commision no comot clear to tell her why dem reject her forms.

She tok say, ""when I bin try to submit my papers, dem say na fake and forgery without say dem tok wetin dia criteria be as to how dem reason say na fake"".

Uganda bin start ot dey run multi-party politics for 2005 afta oen referendum wia ova 90 percent of voters say na so dme want make e run.

Di last four elections wey dem don hold since dat time don get at least one female presidential candidate.

Former First Lady Miria Kalule Obote bin contest for 2006; Beti Kamya bin run for 2011; Maureen Kyalya run for 2016 and for 2021 na Nancy Kalembe Linda be di only female candidate.

Analysts tok say dis one wey woman no dey un for dis current election, e don reduce moral of di efforts to increase women participation for politics and democratic governance.

But even wit all dis ones, Uganda still be one of di African kontris wey get beta number of women for leaderhip positions. Di kontri present Speaker for Parliament, Vice Presidnet and Prime Minister, all fo dem na women and 45% of di cabinet na women. Plus, dem reserve 146 parliamentary seats for district women representatives.

No be only women don chop ela from dis presidential race.

Dis election dey as di kontri dey fce economic strain and redice in institutional trusts. Many young Ugandans no dey look di election as just political event but to test weda di system fit deliver inclusion and opportunity.

Ova 75% of Uganda pipo dey under 30 years and many young pipo don dey hala for economic empowerment and inclusivity.

Twenty-eight-year-old Gloria Nawanyanga wan rep di youth for legislator for di Central Uganda region.

She say, ""if young pipo dey economically empowered, Uganda fit enta middle income status or even turn one of di most developed kontris for world for short time bicos we be majority"".

Political financing don cause plenti pipo to chook eye as critics call out wetin dem call di commercialization of politics. Yvonne Mpambara dey warn say di way wey election dey cost mean say young pipo and oda groups fit no participate.

She tok say, ""I no think say any of us go fit sustain elections for future. Politics don cost like mad, and na discrimination from start. How pesin go fit afford three billion Uganda shillings to contest for Member of Parliament?""

Political financing has also come under scrutiny, with critics condemning the commercialization of politics. Yvonne Mpambara warns that the high cost of elections risks locking out young people and other marginalized groups.

""I don't think any of us will be able to sustain elections in the future. Politics has become extremely expensive, and that's discrimination from the start. How can one afford three billion Uganda shillings to run for Member of Parliament?"" she asks.

Worldwide, youth participation for politics don shift wella. New wave of Gen Z activism don see young pipo dey do protest to ask for beta governance, accountabiltiy and job creations for kontris like Kenya, Bangladesh, Madagascar, Nepal and Morocco.

According to di Uganda 2024 censis, youth unemployment for di kontri still dey high as na only 9.5 million pipo dey employed out of di working age population of 25.1 million.

President Museveni for im campaign ask young pipo to use di kontri peace and stability and use goment youth lifelihood programs wey dey ground. E also say make dem shift from waiting for goment work to start to dey engage for work creation.

But for di opposition National Unity Platform, led by Bobi Wine promise say dem go create ten million million jobs by 2032 for dia  manifesto, A New Uganda Now. Dem also promise to tackle corruption and transform Uganda to tech driven economy.

For young leaders like  Gloria Nawanyanga, di moment for change dey ripe.

She tok say, ""na di right time for young pipo to take oca di stewardship of is kontri cos na us be majority.""

As Uganda dey go vote, di youth vote dey expected to play beta role to shape di kontri leadership.

Atuhire Vandah, wey be 24 year old fish seller for Luzira for outside Kampala say she go like di leadership of di kontri to address corruption.

She say, ""I want di elected to make sure say youth livelihood finds ereach us. We hear say dem release di omey but many of us neva get am bicos of fraud.""

Di voice note na 76 seconds and di young man wey dey inside dey sound desperate. E dey cry dey beg for im papa help.

""E dey hard to hear, to hear im voice dey hurt me,"" na so Musa tell BBC Africa Eye, wey get exclusive access to police unit wey dey help am search for two of im children wey fall victim to scammers.

Na for February 2024 dem recruit Musa 24 years old son and di 18 years old daughter with five odas from dia remote village for Faranah region of Central Guinea. Di agent promise dem work abroad.

Di jobs no work out and di recruiters turn out to be human traffickers. Dem take di group across di border into Sierra Leone and hold dem captive.

""My heart dey broken, I no fit stop to dey cry. If you look inside my eyes, you go see di pains,"" na so Musa tok.

Global policing agency Interpol pick up im case for Guinea and ask dia unit for Sierra Leone to help. So last August, Musa travel go Makeni for central Sierra Leone to go find dem.

Human trafficking scam wey dem dey call QNET dey lure thousands of pipo across West Africa.

Na for Hong Kong dem establish di scam, QNET na legitimate wellness and lifestyle company wey dey allow pipo to sign up and buy dia products and sell dem online.

Di business don face some criticism - however for West Africa, criminal gangs dey use di name as front for dia illegal activities.

Traffickers dey target pipo wit promise of work opportunities for places like US, Canada, Dubai and Europe, dey ask dem to pay large amount of money for administrative cost bifor dem go start di jobs.

Once dem pay, dem go traffic dem to anoda kontri and tell dem say dem go travel abroad only if dem recruit more pipo into di scheme.

Yet even wen dem bring in family and friends di jobs no go still show.

QNET get plenti campaign billboards across di region wit big adverts dey condemn scam like ""QNET against Scams"" and di company don reject di allegations say dem dey linked to human trafficking.

Musa and im extended family don pay di traffickers $25,000 (£19,000). Dis include di joining fees and extra money to use bring im children home. To travel to Sierra Leone na im last hope.

Mahmoud Conteh, wey be head of di investigation for anti-kidnapping unit of Interpol for Sierra Leone police say di case na top priority for im unit dat time.

""E dey veri easy for di traffickers to manoeuvre across our borders for di illegal crossing points,"" na so im tell BBC.

Wen Conteh get tip-off say dem dey hold large number of young pipo for one location for Makeni, Musa join di police to raid di place wit hope say e go find im children.

Dem keep clothes and bags for floor, na ontop dia dem dey sleep. Like 10 to 15 pipo dey sleep for one room dia.

Interpol carry evribodi inside di property and even find some wey dey as young as 14 years wey dey live dia.

""Plenti of dem from Guinea, na only one from Sierra Leone. Odas from Guinea,"" na so Conteh tok.

Dem no see Musa children dia, though one young man tok say di children bin dey dia last week - dis na first time dem dey sight di children for one year.

Dem bin carry all of dem go police station for screening bifor dem return 19 of dem back home to Guinea.

Police say dem don conduct more dan 20 raids like dis over di past one year, say dem rescue hundreds of victims of human trafficking.

Di traffickers don move some of di victims across di border but for 23 years old Aminata wey from Sierra Leone (we change her name to hide her real identity) dem traffic her inside her own kontri.

Aminata tell BBC say na her friend introduce am to di pipo wey dey claim to be representative of QNET for middle of 2024.

She pass her interview and dem tell am say she go do one course bifor she go fly to US for further study and work. But she gatz pay $1000 to join di scheme.

Onto say dem believe say e dey legit, her family give her di money dem bin plan to use send her go college.

""Wen dem first recruit you, dem go feed you, take care of you, but as time dey go, dem go stop,"" na so she tell BBC. She add say na dis time she go extra mile to survive.

""You go sell your body and sleep wit men to get money - so you go fit take care of your body,""

Aminata say dem tell am say if she want travel say she gatz recruit oda pipo into di scheme.

To make dis happun, di traffickers give her international phone number so dat wen she call pipo e go look like she don already travel abroad.

""Dem go carry you go airport, and you go dress well like you want travel, Dem go give you passport give you fake travel papers"" na so she explain.

""Dem go take your fotos so you fit send am to your family and friends.""

Aminata manage to recruit six friends and relatives to join di scheme, and still dey hope say di job for US go work out, but e no work.

""E pain me onto say dem waste dia money, and dem suffer sake of me.""

Na for Freetown outskirts of Sierra Leone Capital dem hold am for about one year bifor e clear for her eyes say di job no go ever show.

Wen Aminata fail to recruit more pesins, e come be like she no dey of any use to di traffickers, so wen she try to escape dem no stop am.

To return home afta evritin wey don happun kon dey hard her, especially as evribodi feel say she don dey leave abroad.

""I bin dey fear to go home"" na so she tok.

""I bin tell my friends say I dey go abroad, I tell my family too di same tin. I dey tink of all di money dem bin give me to go dia.""

Statistics of di number of victims of di dis kain labour scams no dey but constant reports for media for West Africa dey show gangs wey dey scam pipo wey believe say foreign jobs schemes dey real.

BBC join police for three days to do raid for Makeni and meet hundreds of young pipo wey dem traffic across di region from kontris like Burkina Faso, Guinea, Ivory Coast and Mali.

Police say dem don arrest total of 12 suspected traffickers.

But di reality be say dem don only succeed to prosecute only few of such cases successfully. Di authorities dey under-resourced for di region and dem dey often face serious battle to tackle such scams.

US State Department statistics show say since 2022 wey Sierra Leone enact anti-trafficking act for April 2025, dem don only get four trafficking convictions.

Musa neva still find im children and no get choice dan to return to Guinea witout dem for end of September.

Conteh from Interpol later tell BBC say di traffickers later release im children.

BBC find out say Musa daughter don return to Guinea but no gree return to di village and no want make dem interview her.

She neva contact her papa sake of di kain shame such victims dey face wen dis kain scam catch dem.

Nobodi know wia Musa son dey now.

Dia papa still dey desperate till now.

""Afta evritin wey don happun, I just want make dis tin dey ova, make I fit see my children again,"" na so Musa tok.

""We want make dem come back village now, I want make dem dey here wit me.""

Now, Bovino dey expected to leave Minnesota, wey fit signal a shift for di administration tone towards dia immigration crackdown.

In recent days, Bovino don defend immigration raids for Minneapolis, one predominantly Democratic city for di northern part of di United States.

""Di victims na Border Patrol agents,"" e tell CNN State of di Union programme, Reuters news agency report.

Dem launch Trump crackdown for Minneapolis for December afta dem convict some Somali immigrants for one case say dem defraud di state welfare programmes.

Di state na home to di largest community of Somali immigrants for di kontri, di majority of dem na US citizens.

Ova di past year, Bovino, wey dey im mid-50s, don oversee several high-profile immigration raids, including for Los Angeles and Chicago.

E dey known for using wetin e call di ""turn and burn"" tactic of moving in to make quick arrests and leav quick-quick bifor protesters land.

E bin describe di tactic as: ""We go turn and burn to dat next target and di next and di next and di next, and no go stop,"" e tell di Associated Press news agency last year.

Miller, wey be di legal analyst for CBS-TV for Chicago now, tok say dem suppose sack Bovino if ""e turn out say e violate rules and regulations or laws for im capacity"" afta dem do di investigation.

""Di focus of dis operation na rapists, murderers, child molesters, human traffickers. And so, if dose kain violent criminals continue to be di focus, make we get di word out...

""If no be wetin dey happun be dat, den we don dey lose focus.""

Initially, di Trump administration continue to voice support for di immigration raids.

Trump bin tell The Wall Street Journal on 25 January: ""I no like any shooting. I no like am.""

E add: ""But I no like am wen pipo begin protest and e get veri powerful, fully loaded gun wit two magazines loaded up wit bullets also. Dat one too no good.""

Eyewitnesses, local officials and Pretti family don challenge dat account.

Video footage show as Pretti dey feem ICE agents wit im mobile phone and dey help one woman wey di officers push, bifor dem spray two of dem wit pepper spray.

E be like say di administration dey change tactics to de-escalate di situation.

Trump dey send im ""border tsar"" Tom Homan to oversee di Minnesota operation.

Pipo consider Homan as ""a more measured, politically attuned operator"", North American Correspondent Anthony Zurcher write.

On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also say dem go carry out full investigation.

Unlike most of di federal officers dem deploy for di raids, Bovino often no dey wear mask.

According to one interview wit di New York Times, e consider bear hunting one of life pleasures, and e start im law enforcement working as a reserve police officer for di Blue Ridge Mountains for North Carolina.

""Pipo dey underestimate im intelligence sake of im demeanour sometimes, but e dey veri smart,"" Jason Owens, one former Border Patrol chief and friend of Bovino, dey quoted for di same article.

""E just get di kontri-boy demeanour, wia e dey tok about Ma and Pa America, plus im accent, and so a lot of pipo fit dismiss am. Dem dey do am at dia own peril.""

To take risks na part of human nature. Weda na gambling or oda activities, evri day we dey engage in activities wey offer both potential risk and potential reward.

We dey motivated to take dis risks by di release of dopamine. Dis feel-good chemical dey activate di same pleasurable reward pathways for our brains as eating our favourite food, or to dey do kerewa.

For dis case, di poo-poo go dey between red and dark in colour wit mixed color. ""Di more red, di lower di inflammation dey close to di anus,"" Mearín tok.

3. On di oda side,if di poo-poo dey very black and sticky, e fit mean say di pesin get existence of high bleeding in di stomach.

In dat side, dem go need to go do gastroscopy, make dem check say e no be bleeding ulcer for di stomach area or duodenum.

Most times, blood dey show no mean say e dey serious.

But if di blood dey dark and e dey mixed wit di poo-poo, e fit come from di colon or some oda part of di body.

For dis matter, doctors dey recommend make dem do colonoscopy to check for colon polyps, colon cancer or vascular lesions.

Some kontris get colon cancer screening programmes wey pipo ova certain age dey use to examine.

Dis programs dey use faecal occult blood testing to show if sign of colon cancer dey.

Im main challenger, 43-year-old pop star wey turn politician Bobi Wine don promise revolution in governance and sweeping reforms.

Di campaigns dey marked wit disruption of opposition activities, wey include di detention of activists and police wey dey scata rallies.

Wit high rates of youth unemployment for kontri wia majority of di population dey under 30, di economy don bicom key concern for di campaign.

Di election go hold on Thursday 15 January. Polls go open at 07:00 local time (04:00 GMT) and close at 16:00. Dem go allow anyody wey dey queue for dat time to vote.

Di 21.6 million registered voters go take part in three elections:

Museveni and Bobi Wine na di two front-runners among di all-male list of eight hopefuls.

Dis na di second time dem go face each oda for di ballot box. Di president bin win di 2021 poll, wey dey marred by allegations of rigging plus crackdown on di opposition, wit 58% of di vote compared to Bobi Wine 35%.

Yoweri Museveni - National Resistance Movement (NRM)

Museveni bin first take power by force 40 years ago as di leader of one guerrilla army wey bin pledge to restore democracy afta years of civil war and di dictatorship of Idi Amin.

Pipo bin first see am as part of a fresh generation of African leaders wey go usher in a new democratic era, however, growing accusations of human rights abuses and harassment of opposition figures don spoil dat perception.

Critics tok say e don rule wit iron hand since e seize control and e don go back on pledges to step down. E be di only president wey most Ugandans know.

Currently di third longest-serving leader in Africa, Museveni don benefit from two constitutional amendments – e remove age and term limits – wey don allow am to keep running for office.

E argue say na only im be di sole guarantor of stability and progress.

Bobi Wine - National Unity Platform (NUP)

Pipo reason one-time hit maker Bobi Wine, wey im real name na Robert Kyagulanyi, as di strongest of di seven opposition candidates.

At a time, pipo nickname am as ghetto president"", dem see am as pesin wey carry youthful aspirations for change and e enjoy strong support among young, urban, working-class voters.

Bobi Wine establish imsef as a serious contender five years ago, e come second and help restrict Museveni to di lowest share of di vote for any election e don contest. Bobi Wine NUP party bicom di largest opposition force in parliament.

Since dat vote, Bobi Wine don continue to face harassment from di security forces.

Di oda candidates na Frank Bulira, Robert Kasibante, Joseph Mabirizi, Nandala Mafabi, Mugisha Muntu and Mubarak Munyagwa.

Prominent opposition figure Kizza Besigye, wey bin run against Museveni four times, no fit take part for dis year election as e remain for jail on treason charges afta dem arrest am forneighbouring Kenya in 2024. E don deny any wrongdoing.

Economic issues, particularly unemployment dey heavy on di minds of many as dem dey ready to vote.

Di average income per person dey slow but e don dey rise since di pandemic but enough jobs no still dey to match di high numbers of young people wey dey find work.

Concerns also dey ground about poor infrastructure and differences in access to quality education and healthcare.

Di kontri don however manage to avoid di spike in di cost of living wey don affect so many oda countries for di region and lead to pressure on dos in power.

Corruption is another major concern.

Uganda come 140th out of 180 countries on Transparency International annual Corruption Perceptions Index, wit widespread bribery and nepotism wey dey reported in govment institutions.

Pipo don often condemn di way dem take carry out elections for Uganda.

Dis time around, officials tok say di vote go be free and fair but UN experts don warn say dat fit no be di case, as dem cite wetin dem describe as ""pervasive climate of fear"" for Uganda.

During di campaign period, opposition supporters bin face more harassment, wey include arrest on politically motivated charges, rights groups say.

Security forces scata Bobi Wine rallies, unlike dos of Museveni.

Amnesty International bin describe di use of tear gas, pepper spray, beatings, and oda violent acts as ""a brutal campaign of repression"" ahead of di vote.

Di govment say di measures dey necessary to ensure peaceful election and stop anyone from causing riots on election day.

Wen e come to di election itself, Bobi Wine don urge voters to stay for polling stations and safeguard dia ballots to help prevent vote rigging.

But election officials don say make pipo cast dia ballots peacefully and leave, as dem give assurance say di vote counting go dey transparent and party agents, di media and election monitors go observe am.

Critics, however, don question di independence of di electoral commission.

Despite govment denials, fears also dey based on previous experience, of internet shutdown during di election wey dey aimed at preventing pipo from verifying results. Di NUP tok say dem get vote-monitoring app wey fit overcome dis issue by using Bluetooth technology.

If everything go according to plan, kontri pipo suppose know di outcome of di presidential vote by 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Saturday 17 January.

Dis na becos by law dielectoral commission must declaredipresidential result within 48 hours fromdiend of voting.

Polls go close at 16:00 local time on Thursday.

Di counting of votes suppose begin at each polling station as soon as voting close. Dem go transmit di results to one central tallying centre.

Afta her trial, ""dem conduct thorough review of dis case and original rape investigation, by independent officers wey no dey involve before.""

We also seek advice from different CPS area to make sure say e dey independent – but dem still find say dem no get enough evidence to fit pursue di rape charge and dem close the case.

We update di victim throughout the review process, di force tok say dem dey take  ""all rape reports seriously and dem dey do everytin to support rape victims"" and  don ""invest more resources for rape allegations.""

While oranges demsefs get plenty vitamins, in di form of drink, experts warn say orange juice dey deliver sudden rush of sugar go di blood.

Overtime, dis sugar spike fit lead to insulin resistance, wey go raise di risk of diabetes, heart disease plus obesity.

Na so some pipo dey tink, yet, research don start to show say despite say e get plenty sugar, one glass of orange juice evriday fit get different kain health benefits.

To start wit, cohort studies – wey dey track tens of thousands of pipo ova time – show say di chances of pipo wey dey eat plenty citrus fruit to suffer from heart disease and stroke dey low.

Howeva, most of these large studies dey ask pipo about how much fruit dem dey chop, no be how much fruit juice de dey drink.

To chop fruit dey get different effect on di body, wen you compare am wit wen pesin drink fruit juice.

""First of all, na di speed wit which you take chop am,"" Federica Amati, one nutrition scientist for Imperial College London, UK tok.

Amati say if pesin eat two or three oranges – di average amount e dey take to make small glass of orange juice – ""to eat, chew, and swallow dem go take longer time"".

She add, ""In fact, most pipo no go like to take two or three oranges, as dem go see am as too much. Whereas, dem go squeeze dat number of oranges for inside small cup – and pesin go drink am finish within seconds.

Whole fruit also dey rich in fibre, wey dey feed di good bacteria for your gut, and e dey linked to health benefits like reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and colon cancer.

Fibre dey also dey also slow down di flow of sugars into our bloodstream. Dem dey make orange juice – plus oda fruit juices –by crushing and pulping whole fruits, dem go most of di fire for di fruits.

Di end result na say if you compare di blood sugar of pesin wey dey eat whole orange versus di pesin wey dey drink orange juice, di blood sugar of di pesin wey dey take whole orange go rise small, whereas one glass of orange juice get more dramatic effect.

""[In orange juice], dem don free di sugars from dia fibre capsules, and so dem dey absorb very fast for di mouth and for belle. So, dat go lead to rapid rise in blood sugar,"" Amati tok.

Howeva, for most pipo, dat kain rise no be problem, bicos insulin dey released wey dey remove sugar from di bloodstream.

Howeva, for pesin wey get diabetes, one glass of orange juice fit no be good idea.

""I tink di challenge wit fruit juices generally na say technically e dey free of sugars, but no be only dat,"" Amati tok. ""So yes, dem fit make your blood sugar go up, but – especially if dem dey freshly squeezed – dem also get bioactive nutrients in dem like vitamin C.

Signs dey day frequent orange juice drinking fit get plenty benefits, despite high sugar content.

For example, one meta-analysis wey gada di results of 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) discover say drinking 500ml (17 fl oz) of orange juice a day dey associated wit lower blood glucose levels, improved insulin function and lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), known as ""bad cholesterol"" – all signs of good heart health.

No be just heart health; orange juice fit dey good for di brain too.

For one trial, 24 healthy men aged between 30 and 45 drink 240ml (8 fl oz) of 100% orange juice, or one sugary drink wey get di same amount of calories.

Dem test di cognitive function of di participant mood six hours afta drinking the beverage. Di mental faculties of di orange juice group no only increase afta dem drink am, dia subjective feelings of alertness bin also ginger.

Howeva, di participants wey drink orange juice dey manage to retain dia alertness. One glass of orange juice fit e beta choice pass sugary drink. E go boost di brain power and focus for di short term – na one good thing if you get important meeting scheduled for your diary.

Signs dey say orange juice fit get long-term impact on brain health and ageing too. For one second study, Lamport and im team bin ask 37 healthy older adults aged 60-81 to drink either two glasses of 100% orange juice evri day for eight weeks, or two orange-flavoured drinks wey get similar amount of sugar and calories. Older adults wey drink orange juice get beta cognitive function compared to di placebo group afta eight weeks.

Even though explanations dey for why orange juice fit improve health. Oranges get plenty vitamin C, wey dey boost immunity, aid iron absorption and help make collagen for skin. E also contain oda vitamins and minerals like folate, calcium, potassium and thiamine (vitamin B1).

Howeva, di molecules pipo tink say dey behind orange protective role in heart and brain health dey known as flavonoids – one class of plant compounds dem dey see for fruits and vegetables wey dey give plants dia vibrant colours and help protect dem from stress and infection.

Flavonoids get antioxidant properties, wey mean say dem fit neutralise so-called ""free radicals"" – extremely reactive chemicals wey fit damage cells and accelerate biological ageing. Flavonoids also dey well known for dia anti-inflammatory properties.

One compound in particular wey don receive plenty interest na hesperidin – one flavonoid wey present for citrus fruits.

Hesperidin dey thought to be behind orange juice ability to influence blood pressure. For example, one 2025 study suggest say orange juice – and hesperidin – fit work dia wonders by activating genes wey dey help lower inflammation and help blood vessels relax.

Di study bin track 85 adults wey drink 500ml of pure pasteurised orange juice evri day for two months. Afta di end of 60 days, blood tests show say many of di genes wey dey associated wit triggering inflammation and high blood pressure bin bicom less active.

Sabi pipo reason say flavonoids, and hesperidin in particular, dey help blood vessels relax by increasing levels of di gas nitric oxide for di inner lining of blood vessels, known as di endothelium.

According to Lamport, good evidence dey wey show say flavonoids generally fit improve cognitive function and mood.

For instance for one study, 12 overweight women drink 500ml of orange juice evri day for four weeks. At di end of di trial period, di women blood pressure don go down.

Howeva, di two nutritionists wey BBC follow tok, say whole fruit na still di preferred option and di healthier choice.

Oranges no only contain more fibre, but dem dey also retain more flavonoids wey dey very beneficial for health. Polyphenols na di wider class of plant compounds to which flavonoids belong.

""Wen you eat fresh orange, di vitamin C and some of di more oxygen-sensitive nutrients [like flavonoids] no dey oxidise as much bicos dem still dey inside di fibre,"" Amati tok. ""Whereas wen you juice orange, you go destroy di food matrix and dos nutrients go bicom exposed to di air, and so dem oxidise, wey dey reduce dia potency.""

Di Blues don win only one of dia last seven league matches and take only six points from six games for December as dem fall 15 points behind leaders Arsenal.

Di former Leicester manager has bin also change agents - from di Wasserman agency to Jorge Mendes - and im name bin don come up as potential successor to Pep Guardiola for Manchester City, which Maresca bin dismiss.

Also, e don dey avoided wearing club tracksuits - instead choosing to wear im own clothing.

Afta im last game wit Chelsea - di 2-2 draw wit Bournemouth for 30 December - assistant manager Willy Caballero said Maresca bin no feel well to do im post-match media duties, but tori be say im absence na more due to say e don dey tire wit di club.

And e dey even more noticeable wen Chelsea bin post one 52-second video for social media for New Year Eve to summarise dia year, Maresca bin no dey di video.

Although e tok say e no dey vex say e dey manage young squad, e feel say di supporters expectations suppose dey managed regarding wetin dey achievable - especially sake of injuries to Colwill and attacker Cole Palmer.

Now as di Annadale immigration court judge adjourn di case to 27 April, di ex-finance minister go likely remain in detention until di next hearing (for three months).

Sabi pipo explain say if di ex-minister lawyers succeed wit di bond application, den dia client go dey out of di ICE custody wey he go dey attend di substantive immigration hearing.

If dem no succeed or di judge no gree wit dia argument, di detainee go dey inside ICE custody until dia deportation case dey finalized.

Di judge gat di discretion to determine weda pesin be flight risk or di pesin be danger for di community

If pesin dey inside custody during di hearing, di case go fit move fast fast.

For all dis, di detainee get option to appeal if di judge deny dem di bond.

Attorney general for Ghana Dr Dominic Ayine, file extradition request to US authorities for di ex-finance minister.

Dem wan make US authorities carry di minister and his chief of staff wen e be minister, to Ghana make dem face accountability for di time as minister for seven years from 2017 to 2024.

""At dis point, na di US authorities especially di judicial authorities wey go determine whether sufficient evidence dey wey go demand say make di two accused pipo, dey extradited to Ghana to stand trial,"" id attorney general explain.

Di kontris special prosecutor's office already slap di ex-minister and odas wit 78 counts of corruption and related offenses.

According to di special prosecutor Kissi Agyebeng, di ex-minister and oda accused pipo allegedly conspire to set up ""criminal enterprise wey directly and indirectly influence di kontri procurement process to win contracts for di company (SML).""

""Di SML company carry unfair advantage to get transaction audit services, external price verification services, measurement audit for downstream petroleum products and odas form di Ghana govment through di finance ministry and di Ghana revenue authority.""

Kissi Agyebeng di special prosecutor tok say ""dem begin di criminal enterprise for 2017 by di ex-finance minister Ken Ofori-Atta, Emmanuel Kofi Nti (ex-GRA commissioner) and Evans Adusei togeda wit di SML company itself.""

Di prosecutor say dem neva ensure value for money for di contracts dem carry give di SML company wey dem cause financial loss of Ghc 1.4bn ($128m).

Dis be some of di reasons why di kontri dey pursue di ex-minister; oda investigative agencies also dey find di minister to help dem investigate oda cases wey im allegedly dey involved.

Ken Ofori-Atta comot Ghana after his govment lose di 2024 elections wey he say he dey go for medical check-up and surgery – since dat time, he neva return.

Many pipo and political watches say di ex-minister dey run away from accountability and trial - but his lawyers say di minister gat nothing to hide.

Di govment thru di Attorney general and odas say dem go work to ensure say US authorities extradite di ex-minister to Ghana to face di law.

But dem also say dem go welcome any move wey go make di minister return to Ghana faster than di extradition – if ICE fit deport am, dem go happy say he go at least return to Ghana and face accountability like anybody else.

Pipo wey dey close to di ex-minister say tins no go be easy sake of di Ken Ofori-Atta apart from di US visa, also get Canada and UK visa, wia he fit go, but time no tell.

She point out say true-true di Nigeria govment don make some progress especially wit di recent release of 38 Christians wey jaguda pipo bin kidnap from dia church for Kwara State, and anoda 265 wey dem bin abduct from St. Mary's Catholic School for Niger State.

For im response, di NSA Nuhu Ribadu say di Tinubu-administration dey committed to make sure say all citizens of Nigeria dey safe.

""Nigeria na deeply plural society, and di protection of all citizens, Christians, Muslims, and dose of oda beliefs, dey non-negotiable. We dey treat violence framed along religious lines as attack on di Nigerian state,"" Ribadu tok.

E also tok say di response of govment include security operations, di rule of law, humanitarian safeguards, and strategic communication, to make sure say di public go get confidence for wetin govment dey do and unity go dey strengthened.

Ribadu say e dey important to measure progress not by isolated incidents wey happen witin complex security environment, but rada to consider di overall direction of travel, di decisions taken at di highest level of govment, and di institutional capacity being built to prevent, respond to, and punish violence whereva e hapun.

Di White House tok say Homan, wey bin arrive for Minneapolis on Tuesday, go now be di ""main point of contact on di ground"" and e go meet wit city officials.

Dis dey come as Gregory Bovino, wey be di US border patrol oga and public face of di Trump administration mass deportation drive for cities across di US, dey expected to leave di city along wit some of im agents.

Pipo dey see di 64-year Homan as key Trump ally and pesin wey get plenty experience for immigration mata across both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Im na also one of di most vocal defenders of Trump immigration policy and mass deportation drive.

A native of upstate New York, Homan start im career for law enforcement as police officer bifor e join border patrol for 1984 for southern California.

Four years later, e join di Immigration and Naturalization Service as dem dey call am dat time, and e climb through di ranks ova di years.

By 2013 - during di Obama administration - e bin hold one important post as di head of di Enforcement and Removal Operations arm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)

Homan bin don plan to retire for 2017, just days bifor Trump first administration start, but di incoming Chief of Staff John Kelly call am as e dey celebrate im retirement party, and dat call change im plans.

""I remember as e tell me say, I know say dis na bad timing, but di president-elect want me to stay and run [Ice],"" Homan tok for one interview last year wit di Daily Caller. ""Monday morning, I call [Kelly] and tell am say I wan come back.""

Anoda call from current Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, again bring am out retirement for 2024 ahead of di second administration.

While di title ""border tsar"" na informal term and position, e refer to di executive-branch role wey dey oversee border and immigration policy across multiple agencies. E no need Senate confirmation, and na policy position wey be say na di serving president dey appoint am directly.

So far for Trump second term, Homan na vocal defender of di president deportation goals, and e don vow to target di ""worst of di worst"" and to challenge di notion say ""dose wey dey enforce di law na di bad guys and dose wey dey break di law na di victims"".

But true-true, as dem dey enforce immigration laws and attempting to focus on public safety threats, di net don also catch oda undocumented migrants wey no get any criminal background.

Homan acknowledge dis fact but e blame am on ""sanctuary cities"" wey no dey work wit federal immigration efforts. Officials tok say di act of being in di US illegally na crime on im own.

""We no go instruct Ice say make dem no arrest pesin unless e commit a serious crime,"" Homan tell tori pipo in July for di White house wia e dey appear regularly.

""Wetin be di message e go send to di whole world? Go ahead and enta di kontri,"" Homan add.

For September, di White House kiakia defend Homan afta dem accuse am for one bribery mata wey di justice department later drop.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt describe dat case - wey accuse Homan say e bin accept $50,000 from undercover agents - as effort to ""entrap"" ogbonge Trump ally.

Unlike Homan,Bovinodon spend almost im entire law enforcement career for border cities, as e bin first joine Border Patrol for 1996 and e don serve for plenty US domestic postings as well as overseas for Honduras and Africa.

Di North Carolina native bicom veri popular for di Trump second term, taking di lead during immigration crackdowns for Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Minneapolis.

Bovino don serve as ""commander-at-large"" for Border Patrol - wey be informal role outside of di organisation formal hierarchy. Border Patrol na one of several immigration-centred agencies wey dey operate under di Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Bovino dey reportedly answer directly to di DHS head Kristi Noem. For im informal role, e dey work alongside officials like di Chief of Border Patrol, Michael Banks, and di Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.

Bovino tactics dey controversial, especially di  aggressive ""turn and burn"" method wey e dey use to arrest bifor protesters fit arrive to any area.

""We go dey turn and burn to dat next target and di next and di next and di next,"" e tell AP of di tactic. ""We no go stop.""

Bovino don also get di reputation as official wey dey willing to clash wit lawmakers.

For example, Bovino don publicly quarrel wit lawmakers wey bin express concern about im operations for Minneapolis recently, from both di Democratic and Republican parties.

As Homan dey replace Bovino for Minneapolis, some political sabi pipo see am as recognition from di White House say urgent change dey needed amid growing public concern.

But for practice, dat change no go too change di administration approach to immigration enforcement.

""Homan get more years at Ice and for interior enforcement work,"" former DHS immigration official Lora Ries tell di BBC. ""Dis no be surprise to me.""

Ries, wey be di head of  border security and immigration centre for di conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation for Washington, add say as Homan don tok say im dey focus ""on di worst, first"", all deportable undocumented migrants go continue to dey ""on di table"".

For immigration activists, Homan career - wey don include strong defence of Trump family separation policy, wey bin lead to separating children from parents wey dey for di kontri illegally - also mean say dem see little practical difference between am and Bovino.

""I no sure say e mean much. Homan na career deportation advocate, and di architect of family separation,"" Michael Lukens tok - im be executive director of di Amica Center, organisation wey dey help immigrants wit legal access and services.

""I tink say di difference be say e dey more polished dan Bovino. E dey beta at speaking to di press, and stakeholders,"" e add. ""E beta for wetin dem need, pesin wey go paint dia actions as somtin wey e no be.""

""Dis na more about weda di White House go see dis as political issue, no be human issue,"" Lukens add.

Di plant no dey in use for over 30 years.

Metres away, tractors wey belong to di agency wey get di task of cleaning up oil spills – di Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep) - dey work to remove pollution.

Ledisi Nomkia, a local farmer, point to one old cassava plants wey show di effects of oil spillage.

""Bifor oil spoil evritin, we bin get di best garri,"" she tok.

""Wen you plant cassava, you go harvest wetin to chop and sell. But now all dat wan don go, you go need a lot of fertilizers to get am to grow. We bin dey plant yam, cocoyam and watermelon but now we no fit,"" she tok.

E don reach 30 years since a group of nine activists from di Movement for di Survival of di Ogoni People (MOSOP) bin dey executed for case wey make  headlines around di world.

Di group wey writer Ken Saro-Wiwa lead, dey known for dia protests against pollution wey dem say na di Royal Dutch Shell Oil Corporation cause am, wey don dey collect oil from di region since di late 1950s.

Di activists say oil spills don spoil farm and coastal land and make di area uninhabitable.

Ledum Mitee, a lawyer and Saro-Wiwa deputy in MOSOP, bin chop arrest and dem try am wit di Ogoni nine but e escape death as dem find am not guilty.

""We form MOSOP and raise awareness by peaceful means for justice and for environmental remediation,"" e tok.

""Wen dis kontinu under di military regime, a lot of activities happun, many pipo bin dey killed.""

Di casualties include four Ogoni chiefs wey bin dey opposed to MOSOP campaign and wey bin dey brutally murdered in 1994.

Despite concerns by human rights groups over di judicial process, dem hang Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight oda MOSOP activists for di crime in November 1995.

For October 2025, wen di 30-year anniversary of di executions happun, both di ""Ogoni nine"" activists and di ""Ogoni four"" chiefs bin get posthumous pardons by Nigeria president Bola Ahmed Tinubu.

Di move come as di federal govment dey consider to restart drilling, three decades after di killings bin throw di region into crisis.

Di Nigerian govment don publicly indicate say dem dey  look into Ogoniland as dem dey  target oil production of 1.8 million barrels per day by di end of 2025, and three million barrels per day by 2030.

But National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu say di main goal behind di pardons na reconciliation.

""One of di biggest challenges we face as a kontri na dat of di Ogoni wey lead to di crisis, di insecurity wey affect lives, environment and di pipo,"" e tok of di region.

K-Dere no be di only community wey dey suffer from di destructive impact of oil spillage.

For 2008 a massive oil spill from Shell pipelines devastate neighbouring Bodo community.

For 2014, Shell settle wit di community in one of several lawsuits over oil spills and environmental damage for di Niger Delta.

However, di company don repeatedly deny wrongdoing, and dey maintain say environmental pollution dey caused by sabotage and ""di wahala of oil theft and illegal mining"" wey dem say dem no dey liable.

For 2021, one Dutch court order Shell to compensate farmers for spills wey contaminate large areas of farmland and fishing waters for di Niger Delta. Di company agree to pay more dan a hundred million dollars.

Today, fisherman Gbea Kpanbari say e still dey avoid di river becos of oil contamination.

""All di periwinkles, crabs and di mangroves don die and wen we travel to anoda local govment like Bonny to fish, e dey cause conflict,"" e tok.

In 2011, a United Nations Environment Programme report conclude way di environmental restoration of Ogoniland dey possible but fit take from 25 to 30 years.

Based on dat report, in 2017 di Nigerian govment, under di administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, set in motion a $1 billion clean-up and restoration programme.

But almost a decade later, di effort to clean up di land dey criticised by residents and environmental activists say e dey slow and inadequate.

Howeva, plenti tok don come ontop dis tax mata as pipo dey debate if e go reduce dia burden or e go add to am.

For di statement on 30 December 2025, President Tinubu say no major issue dey for dem to stop di reform process and say make Nigerians trust di process as di reform dey begin.

BBC News Pidgin sidon wit oga Taiwo Oyedele wey dey head di tax reform committee to ansa some key questions wey dey worry Nigerians.

Oga Oyedele say di new tax law na to ease di burden of tax ontop Nigerians.

E say any Nigerian wey dey earn income gatz tell govment if di money wey dey enta dia account na dia own, loan or na anoda pesin get am.

""But if plenti money dey your account and you no tell govment wetin e be, weda na income or no be income, govment fit come to you and say we dey see dis kain money for your account, we tink say na income wey you suppose pay tax.""

Oga Oyedele confam say govment get access to information inside your bank accounts.

E add say di new tax law go allow make pipo fit pay for food and oda basic consumption wey dem need evriday.

""Poor pipo wey dey pay tax, di tax dey too much, so dis reform na to take away di burden of tax, so dem go get space to breathe.""

""Dem go be able to pay for food, rent, education, accommodation and transportation. Di tax wey dey for all dis basic consumption, we don remove am.""

Oga Oyedele say pipo wey no dey make money or dey make small money, dem go dey exempt from di new tax law.

Also, e tok on pipo wey dey dodge tax wey dem suppose pay.

""Inside Nigeria, plenti pipo wey suppose dey pay money dey dodge tax wey be say dem no go even pay anytin, weda dem dey make billions of naira, dem no dey pay, and govment dey allow dem to get away wit not paying.""

""Under dis new law, dat no go hapun again. So wen you make pipo wey dey dodge tax to pay di tax, make rich people pay a little bit more, govmemt money go come.""

You fit find more details ofwho go pay tax and who no go pay for here.

Oga Oyedele during di interview say Nigeria don introduce di progressive tax system wey be say na di rich go dey pay more tax becos dem earn more

E say for di progressive tax system ""pesin wey poor no suppose pay tax, pesin wey dey middle class suppose pay small and pesin wey be upper class dey make plenti of money and suppose to pay more.""

""So di money wey govment go collect to run di economy go come from pipo wey dey make plenti of money.""

""From 2026, di reform be say you go pay less tax if you be low income earner, you go pay low tax if you be middle class you go pay less tax, but if you be rich pesin, you suppose pay a lit bit more.""

Plenti Nigerians home and abroad dey confused weda if dia family members wey dey outside di kontri send dem money, dem go comot tax.

""If pesin send money from abroad give you, no tax. If pesin give you gifts weda from inside or outside Nigeria, no tax.""

""So long as e no be your income for di service wey you render or maybe you just sell something. Like if you dey sell cars, or you dey sell phones, na dat one dey taxable.""

E get anoda tori say Nigeria don partner wit different countries so dem go fit track pipo wey dey work for dem for Nigeria.

Oga Oyedele confam am say na true, say Nigeria don signup for dat intelligence say pipo no go fit dey hide dia income from govment again.

""Nigeria no be di only kontri, more dan 100 kontris all ova di world, dem don agree, dem call am common reporting standard""

""If I see anytin wey your citizens dey do for my kontri I go tell you, you too if you see anytin wey my citizens dey do for your kontri, you go tell me back.""

""Na im be say if you dey do sometin online, you dey make cool money wey no bad, but you dey hide am from govment, govmemt go fit find out from dose intelligence from oda kontris.

Oga Oyedele say make pipo dey honest for dia income becos if govment later find out your income and you no dey pay tax, e go come wit penalty and interest.

Oga Oyedele say na lie say dem godebit money from bank accounts wey get tax IDand Tax Identification Number (TIN). E call am fake news.

""Anoda fake news be say pipo tok say from next year January, dem go take money from your account becos you get tax ID and TIN, dem go debit your account.

""If you get bank account and you dey use am for business, you suppose get TIN, e no mean say dem go tax you, e just mean say govment dey interested  for wetin you dey do, in case you dey make plenti of money, you suppose pay tax.""

According to Oyedele, e say di new tax reform no go cause inflation like many pipo dey tok.

""From 2026, dis reform go reduce di price of food weda you dey buy bread or weda you dey buy garri, or yam, price go come down.""

Ontop VAT mata, e say dem don comot am from basic consumption items wey Nigerians dey use.
