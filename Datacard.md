## Quality Metrics

### 1. Label Quality

**Annotation Reliability Indicators:**
- **Average lead time** reflects thoughtful annotation (not rushed):
  - Igbo IQS: 291.09 seconds per document
  - Pidgin NER: 77.69 seconds per document
- **Human-in-the-loop workflow** ensures accuracy beyond pure automation
- **High segmentation coverage** (98.41%) demonstrates comprehensive annotation
- **Low unannotated rate** in NER (2/91 samples = 2.2%)

### 2. Class Balance Entropy

Entropy measures the balance of class distributions (higher = more balanced):

| Dataset | Task | Entropy (bits) | Interpretation |
|---------|------|----------------|----------------|
| Igbo IQS | Intent | 1.2229 | Moderate imbalance (news-reporting dominant) |
| Igbo IQS | Tone | 1.5353 | Good balance across sentiment classes |
| Pidgin IQS | Intent | 1.2992 | Moderate imbalance (news-reporting dominant) |
| Pidgin IQS | Tone | 1.8690 | High balance (nearly even distribution) |
| Pidgin IQS | Language Quality | 0.2091 | Severe imbalance (reflects real-world Pidgin usage) |
| Pidgin NER | Entity Types | 2.3066 | Good balance across entity categories |

**Interpretation:**
- **Intent distributions** reflect authentic BBC news content (predominantly reporting)
- **Tone balance** in Pidgin is excellent for training robust sentiment models
- **Language quality** imbalance reflects authentic Nigerian Pidgin (naturally mixed with English)
- **Entity type balance** enables effective multi-class NER training

### 3. Average Labels Per Item

| Dataset | Average Labels | Description |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Igbo IQS | 2.0 | Intent + Tone per document |
| Pidgin IQS | 3.0 | Intent + Tone + Language Quality per document |
| Igbo Segmentation | 0.98 | Near-complete sentence boundary annotation |
| Pidgin NER | 53.31 | Dense entity annotation (0–240 entities per document) |

### 4. Long-tail Distribution

Distribution of how concentrated labels are in top classes:

| Dataset | Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|---------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Igbo IQS | Intent classes covering 80% | 1/4 classes | Heavy concentration in news-reporting |
| Igbo IQS | Tone classes covering 80% | 1/4 classes | Neutral tone dominant |
| Pidgin IQS | Intent classes covering 80% | 1/4 classes | News-reporting dominant |
| Pidgin IQS | Tone classes covering 80% | 2/4 classes | More balanced distribution |
| Pidgin NER | Entity types covering 80% | 4/7 types | PERSON, LOCATION, DATE, ORG dominant |

**Implications:**
- **News-reporting bias** is expected and appropriate for BBC content
- **Sentiment diversity** provides good coverage despite neutral dominance
- **Entity diversity** is strong, though some rare entity types may need augmentation

### 5. Label Frequency Variance

Variance measures inequality in label distribution (higher = more skewed):

| Dataset | Label Type | Variance | Interpretation |
|---------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Igbo IQS | Intent | 313.58 | High variance (news-reporting dominates) |
| Igbo IQS | Tone | 211.58 | Moderate variance |
| Pidgin IQS | Intent | 799.58 | Very high variance |
| Pidgin IQS | Tone | 124.92 | Low variance (balanced) |
| Pidgin IQS | Language Quality | 3,612.50 | Extreme variance (reflects real Pidgin) |
| Pidgin NER | Entity Types | 333,815.71 | High variance (PERSON/LOCATION dominant) |

**Key Insights:**
- High variance in **intent** reflects authentic news corpus composition
- Low variance in **tone** (Pidgin) indicates excellent sentiment diversity
- Extreme variance in **language quality** represents actual Pidgin-English continuum
- NER variance driven by PERSON/LOCATION frequency in news content

## Limitations and Risks

### Dataset Limitations

1. **Domain Specificity**
   - **Scope:** Exclusively news content from BBC
   - **Impact:** May not generalize to other domains (social media, literature, technical documents)
   - **Mitigation:** Use in combination with domain-specific data for broader applications

2. **Class Imbalance**
   - **Intent:** Heavy bias toward "news-reporting" (60-71% of samples)
   - **Tone:** Neutral tone dominates Igbo dataset (55.6%)
   - **Language Quality:** Mixed Pidgin-English is predominant (96.7%)
   - **Impact:** Models may overfit to majority classes
   - **Mitigation:** Apply class weighting, oversampling, or focal loss during training

3. **Limited Scale**
   - **Size:** 63 Igbo and 91 Pidgin samples
   - **Impact:** May be insufficient as sole training data for large models
   - **Mitigation:** Use for fine-tuning pre-trained models or combine with synthetic/augmented data

4. **Sentence Segmentation Coverage**
   - **Igbo:** Only 62/63 samples have sentence boundaries annotated
   - **Impact:** 1.59% of documents lack segmentation labels
   - **Mitigation:** Minor—exclude unannotated sample or use for other tasks

5. **Single-Source Bias**
   - **Source:** All content from BBC News
   - **Impact:** Reflects BBC's editorial perspectives and style
   - **Mitigation:** Recognize journalistic bias; combine with diverse sources if available

6. **Temporal Coverage**
   - **Period:** Articles up to January 2026
   - **Impact:** May not reflect newer linguistic trends or current events beyond this date
   - **Mitigation:** Periodic updates recommended for time-sensitive applications

7. **Annotator Consistency**
   - **Concern:** Most datasets annotated by single annotators
   - **Impact:** Limited inter-annotator agreement metrics
   - **Mitigation:** High lead times suggest quality; Pidgin IQS has 2 annotators for validation

### Potential Risks

1. **Representational Bias**
   - News content may not represent all Igbo or Pidgin language varieties
   - BBC framing may introduce cultural or political perspectives
   - Predominantly Nigerian contexts may not cover diaspora usage

2. **Ethical Considerations**
   - Named entities include real individuals mentioned in news
   - Some content may involve sensitive topics (politics, conflicts)
   - Users must respect privacy and contextual integrity

3. **Performance Limitations**
   - Models trained solely on this data may underperform on:
     - Casual conversation or social media text
     - Technical or specialized domains
     - Dialectal variations beyond BBC's standardized Igbo/Pidgin

4. **Perpetuation of Imbalance**
   - Training on imbalanced data may amplify majority class predictions
   - Critical or negative sentiment may be underrepresented in Igbo

### Recommended Mitigations

✅ **Best Practices:**
- **Combine with other datasets** when available (e.g., JW300, MENYO-20k for Igbo)
- **Apply data augmentation** for minority classes
- **Use stratified splits** to maintain class distribution in train/dev/test
- **Report performance per class** not just overall accuracy
- **Validate on diverse test sets** beyond news domain
- **Attribute source material** in accordance with CC-BY-4.0 license
- **Consider cultural context** when interpreting model outputs
